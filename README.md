### Intro: What is Ray Tracing?
Ray tracing is one of the techniques for global illumination in the field of Computer Graphics. In Computer Graphics, global illumination refers to a set of 3D lighting algorithms 
that are capable of not only simulating the light coming directly from a light source but also those reflected off other surfaces in the scene. The concept of global illumination 
exists in contrast to local illumination, in which only the light coming directly from a light source is simulated. In a nutshell, ray tracing algorithm, in its simplest form, allows 
a 3D object in the scene to cast shadow on another 3D object.
